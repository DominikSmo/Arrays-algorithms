# Merging four arrays with different lengths each

This exercise has the same task as an exercise from a third repository. However, the way of solution is another. In an exercise from a third repository I wanted to merge four arrays with different lengths in one, starting from filling the longest array.

  Each next array was shorter than the previous. That exercise could be solved by a try-catch block. But in an exercise from the fourth repository I started from filling the shortest array. Then I was filling the next arrays successively. 
It was based on subtraction of the numbers of indices from the shortest array from concrete numbers.
